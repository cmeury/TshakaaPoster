This is a private project for a link to IRC channel sharer. It uses
a simple GET request to post the data.

It's not really of use for anyone else than me an a few friends. But anyhow,
if you would like to try it out, get rid of the URL in
	ch.wurmlo.android.tshakaa.PortalCommunication
or else we get spammed ;-)
